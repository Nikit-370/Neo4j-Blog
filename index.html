        <section>
            <p>Hey there! 👋</p>
            <p>
                I recently earned my Neo4j Certified Professional badge — and what a fun ride it's been! From diving
                into graph data modeling to writing Cypher queries that actually *felt* like English, it was an
                eye-opener into how data can be visualized and connected. This blog highlights key learnings, practical
                examples, and how Neo4j is shaping my view of modern data systems.
            </p>

            <h2>🌐 Why Graph Databases?</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional databases are great at storing rows and columns, but they often fall short when you want to
                understand relationships — like which users follow each other or how entities are linked. That’s where
                Neo4j and graph databases shine.
            </p>
            <p>Think of it like a web of knowledge: nodes are entities and relationships define how they connect.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>📚 What the Certification Covers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Concepts: Nodes, Relationships, Labels, and Properties</li>
                <li>Cypher syntax for querying and data manipulation</li>
                <li>Data modeling best practices using real-life scenarios</li>
                <li>Graph imports using CSV and Neo4j Desktop tools</li>
                <li>Visualizing data via Neo4j Browser and Bloom</li>
                <li>Python integration using the Neo4j Bolt Driver</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🧠 Hands-On Examples</h2>
            <p>I built a movie database that allowed me to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find co-actors using pattern matching</li>
                <li>Track actor-director collaborations</li>
                <li>Visualize genres and rating connections</li>
            </ul>

            <pre><code>// Find actors who worked with Keanu Reeves
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coActor:Actor {name: "Keanu Reeves"})
RETURN DISTINCT a.name
</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔎 What Makes Neo4j Unique?</h2>
            <p>Some key differentiators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cypher</strong> – the SQL-like query language that’s intuitive and readable</li>
                <li><strong>Index-free adjacency</strong> – faster traversals with connected data</li>
                <li><strong>Developer-first tools</strong> – great docs, sandbox environments, and integrations</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🚀 Where Can You Use It?</h2>
            <p>Real-world applications of graph databases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recommendation Systems</strong> – like Netflix or Spotify’s "You May Also Like"</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Detection</strong> – identifying suspicious connections in finance</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Graphs</strong> – connecting unstructured data for enterprises</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Analysis</strong> – tracking dependencies and delays</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>📈 What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to explore more advanced topics like Graph Data Science (GDS), Neo4j Bloom, and building a
                Flask-based web app powered by Neo4j.
            </p>
            <p>Stay tuned—I'll post follow-ups on GitHub and LinkedIn!</p>

            <h2>🎓 Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Honestly, I went in just curious — and came out with a deeper appreciation for connected data. I highly
                recommend this certification for devs, analysts, or anyone working with relationships in data.
